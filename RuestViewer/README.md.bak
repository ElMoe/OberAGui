# RuestViewer

This is a simple GUI to read a .csv-File and generate the RuestMatrix from it.

Install via pip with: `pip install . `

Input Files should be stored in "data/" and can be loaded then specified in the settings.
Default Values are stored in "settings/defaultValues.csv" and are automatically read when the program is started.
